functions for data cleaning csv file before upload in DigitaleBox account
this small app is blocks of functions

# philisophy 

take input file (utf8 csv) and generate output file
output is cleaned by function

workflow is like a step by step: 

function clean_number(file_to_clean) = > generate clean_number
function clean_date(clean_number) => generate clean_date

So each time you get a file. 
You chose wich function you want, there is no order.
